# Decoding-NFL-Injuries-Risk-Factors-Recurrence-and-Predictive-Insights

The study aims to understand the contributing factors more comprehensively by incorporating a wide range of variables, including player demographics, position-specific demands, and environmental factors such as playing surface type on NFL injuries over the five-year period from 2019 to 2023 to determine whether there is statistically significance between these independent factors such as player positions, age, years of experience, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), surface type, team and the dependent factor (report status) to predict the potential playing status of a player with certain characteristics. In this prediction, our target feature is the report status where “Out” status indicates that a player is not able to participate due to injury.. This study leverages Logit Regression and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost to predict player injury status, focusing on whether players are "Out" due to injury. Results indicate that variables such as primary injury type, body mass index (BMI), and player age are significant predictors of injury status, with younger players (aged 23-29) and those with higher BMI (25-29.9) being at greater risk and the Defensive Back position (DB) is the most prone to injury, artificial turfs and hybrid turfs contribute significantly to NFL injuries and age group between 23-29 are the most susceptible to NFL injuries. Machine learning models, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, demonstrated superior predictive performance over Logistic Regression and Decision Tree suggesting the potential for these advanced models in developing more effective injury prevention strategies. This study will provide NFL team managements and healthcare professionals with a broader understanding and insights of the relationship between NFL sports injuries and key factors influencing injuries.
